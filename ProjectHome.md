A Javadoc Wiki Doclet is used to create Wiki output from Javadoc.

This Project was made by Students.

The Doclet itself creates the Page Markup and saves it in an XML File Format.

This XML File can then be transported to the Mediawiki with the Transporter Utility. This Split was done to have better control over when and where the upload will happen, since it can cause large Load on the Server.

The Transporter is optimized to upload only the changed Pages and not everything.
